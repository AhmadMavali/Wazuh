Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring and threat detection platform. It provides host-based intrusion detection, log analysis, file integrity monitoring, and vulnerability assessment capabilities. Wazuh helps organizations detect and respond to security incidents by collecting, analyzing, and correlating security-related data from various sources.

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open-source threat intelligence platform that enables organizations to collect, share, and collaborate on threat intelligence information. It allows the exchange of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), threat intelligence reports, and other security-related data.

The integration between Wazuh and MISP allows organizations to enhance their security monitoring and incident response capabilities by leveraging shared threat intelligence. Here's an overview of the integration:

IOC Sharing: Wazuh can send IOCs detected on monitored hosts, such as IP addresses, domains, hashes, or file names, to MISP. This enables the automatic dissemination of IOCs to the MISP platform, where they can be shared with other organizations or used for further analysis.

Threat Intelligence Enrichment: Wazuh can retrieve threat intelligence information from MISP and enrich security events with additional context. By querying MISP for IOCs related to security events, Wazuh can provide more comprehensive information about the nature and severity of detected threats.

Correlation and Analysis: Wazuh can correlate security events with threat intelligence data from MISP. This helps identify patterns, detect advanced threats, and prioritize incident response activities based on the relevance and severity of the associated IOCs.

Incident Response: The integration enables security teams to streamline their incident response processes. When Wazuh detects a security incident, it can automatically query MISP for additional information about the associated IOCs, aiding in the investigation and remediation of the incident.

By integrating Wazuh with MISP, organizations can benefit from the collective knowledge and intelligence shared within the MISP community. This collaboration enhances the detection capabilities of Wazuh and enables more effective threat hunting, incident response, and mitigation of security threats.
